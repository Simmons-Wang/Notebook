# Notes for probability

1. There are 26 black(B) and 26 red(R) cards in a standard deck. A run is number of blocks of consecutive cards of the same color. For example, a sequence RRRRBBBRBRB of only 11 cards has 6 runs; namely, RRRR, BBB, R, B, R, B. Find the expected number of runs in a shuffled deck of cards.

We can use inducton method to solve it. Letâ€™s call n is the expected numbers runs in 2i cards.

i = 1. n = 2

i = 2, n = 3 = (1 + 2) * 2 / 2



so n = i + 1
