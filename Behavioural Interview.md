ESG在未来10年内有着非常好的发展前景，特别是气候变化，对于经济社会、企业评估的影响越来越大。但是目前ESG数据仅仅在起到很小的参考作用，很难有系统化的对策，着来源于对于数据获取能力和分析能力的不足。数据科学将会在ESG领域带来巨大的进步，例如自然语言处理，机器学习，数据爬取。

德勤始终追求可持续发展理念，ESG是德勤的重要发展方向，ESG数据的支持将极大提升我们和客户对于隐藏风险的发现，对于潜在机会的把握，也真正有益于环境，社会，发展。

我非常欣赏德勤对数据科学在ESG领域应用的大力支持，我愿意和德勤一起在这个领域中保持行业领先的地位，不断的专注于德勤的培训，我目前还不是一个专业的数据科学家和ESG专家，但是我会努力利用好培训机会。成为一个优秀的数据科学家和ESG专家是我的最高目标。

example.

上学期我收到了本科导师的邀请，参与到教材《大数据金融》的编写中，并对其中的第三章至第五章的编写团队负责。主要的内容是统计学习和机器学习方法的基础介绍和在金融领域中的应用案例开发。在两个月的时间内，我对于我的团队的要求始终是要有严谨的规划和充分的沟通。每周更新的时间表和例会是我的方式，特别是对于案例，我们要求原创数据和代码，力求探索真正有用的金融应用。

这其中遇到的问题是，特别是在第五章涉及的岭回归和lasso回归中，负责的同学对于知识的掌握不够透彻，初稿中也出现了较多的错误。在实际工作中我们也会遇到团队中有短板的情况，我的解决方法是将解决问题作为第一要务，及时指出不足，在不耽误其他进度的前提下，更多的人力和精力加入到这一部分的编写中。

在这个过程中，我提升了交流能力，*managing multiple tasks and deadlines.*，而且作为leader也要对总体任务有一个基础的了解，能够对准确性有最后的把关。

当然这其中我也是有不足的，我对于章节内容加入了不少自己的想法，而没有及时的与导师沟通，不擅作主张，这一点是我之后要注意的。

## why do you want to be a quant developer

1. I really like math since I am younger,  I am always try my best to find a better, wiser solution for a problem. But sometimes I find I am not so love theorical math, what I am really like is use math to slove practical problem, which means I want to be an  engineer instead of scientist. especail when I study finance, math is the best way  for me to understand the finance world.
2. when I  begin to study programming, I find the other hobby, coding. the programming language give me the power, the magic , to dig into data, to find pattern, to compute fast, to create new application, to be faster.
3. when I start to do internship in quant fund or do research about QIS, I find that quant developer is the perfect place to combine the engieering with algorithm. which also means, turn my hobbies into the work.

2. I actively particapate in several research projects, they include sentiment ana, enviro, and green finance, I get experience in data visual, web crawl, scienctific computing and other things. even when I graduate , my undergraduate supervisor call me to contribute to his project and his textbook because of my coding skill.
3. during internship. everything is about coding. classification, regression, visual. but internship encourage me to improve my skill, for example, when I deal with large-size dataset, it is really too slow if we use for loop. so pandas is better. but sometimes the method such as rolling is very limited, numpy has more extensibility, such as stride_tricks and so on. if it is still not fast enough, we use numba, use cython, use parallel and muti-processing.
