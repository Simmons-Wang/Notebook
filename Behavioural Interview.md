ESG在未来10年内有着非常好的发展前景，特别是气候变化，对于经济社会、企业评估的影响越来越大。但是目前ESG数据仅仅在起到很小的参考作用，很难有系统化的对策，着来源于对于数据获取能力和分析能力的不足。数据科学将会在ESG领域带来巨大的进步，例如自然语言处理，机器学习，数据爬取。

德勤始终追求可持续发展理念，ESG是德勤的重要发展方向，ESG数据的支持将极大提升我们和客户对于隐藏风险的发现，对于潜在机会的把握，也真正有益于环境，社会，发展。

我非常欣赏德勤对数据科学在ESG领域应用的大力支持，我愿意和德勤一起在这个领域中保持行业领先的地位，不断的专注于德勤的培训，我目前还不是一个专业的数据科学家和ESG专家，但是我会努力利用好培训机会。成为一个优秀的数据科学家和ESG专家是我的最高目标。

上学期我收到了本科导师的邀请，参与到教材《大数据金融》的编写中，并对其中的第三章至第五章的编写团队负责。主要的内容是统计学习和机器学习方法的基础介绍和在金融领域中的应用案例开发。在两个月的时间内，我对于我的团队的要求始终是要有严谨的规划和充分的沟通。每周更新的时间表和例会是我的方式，特别是对于案例，我们要求原创数据和代码，力求探索真正有用的金融应用。

这其中遇到的问题是，特别是在第五章涉及的岭回归和lasso回归中，负责的同学对于知识的掌握不够透彻，初稿中也出现了较多的错误。在实际工作中我们也会遇到团队中有短板的情况，我的解决方法是将解决问题作为第一要务，及时指出不足，在不耽误其他进度的前提下，更多的人力和精力加入到这一部分的编写中。

在这个过程中，我提升了交流能力，*managing multiple tasks and deadlines.*，而且作为leader也要对总体任务有一个基础的了解，能够对准确性有最后的把关。

当然这其中我也是有不足的，我对于章节内容加入了不少自己的想法，而没有及时的与导师沟通，不擅作主张，这一点是我之后要注意的。

## why do you want to be a quant developer

1. I really like math since I am younger,  I am always try my best to find a better, wiser solution for a problem. But sometimes I find I am not so love theorical math, what I am really like is use math to slove practical problem, which means I want to be an  engineer instead of scientist. especail when I study finance, math is the best way  for me to understand the finance world.
2. when I  begin to study programming, I find the other hobby, coding. the programming language give me the power, the magic , to dig into data, to find pattern, to compute fast, to create new application, to be faster.
3. when I start to do internship in quant fund or do research about QIS, I find that quant developer is the perfect place to combine the engieering with algorithm. which also means, turn my hobbies into the work.



## how much coding experience:

1. I complete several programming courses at school, including pyhton, R, cpp, my favourite and most skilled is python. also there are some practical course such as machince learning, text tech give me more chance to practice it.
2. I actively particapate in several research projects, they include sentiment ana, enviro, and green finance, I get experience in data visual, web crawl, scienctific computing and other things. even when I graduate , my undergraduate supervisor call me to contribute to his project and his textbook because of my coding skill.
3. during internship. everything is about coding. classification, regression, visual. but internship encourage me to improve my skill, for example, when I deal with large-size dataset, it is really too slow if we use for loop. so pandas is better. but sometimes the method such as rolling is very limited, numpy has more extensibility, such as stride_tricks and so on. if it is still not fast enough, we use numba, use cython, use parallel and muti-processing.



## key skill to be a quant developer

- Proficiency with programming language
- communication skill and team work skills
- software engineering
- mathematics knowledge
- problem solving and fast learning
- focus and concetrate in a fast-moving environment
- scientific computing and statistic
- seek perfection



## why do you want to work here (seamless cap)

- I am always wondering and trying how ml can work in qis, some people do not believe machine learning. most of qis only appeared in papers,  real QIS do not trust ml.  can play a  role in financial world. and when i try to implement ml method, I also find some problem, such as the long training and updating time,  easily overfitting, not so clear economical logic. when we deal with alternative sdata, ml also have a high requirment for data quality and data size. but seamless put effort to research ml, I want to learn it,  and figure out the difference.
- 我曾经是学金融的，传统金融，教授会教我们如何评价一家公司，如何分析他的财务状况，如何判断未来他的股价会不会涨，这些太主观了，特别是在中国，90%的研报给出的结论都是bullshit，useless and random，我不喜欢这些，我就开始越来越多的学习编程和ml，最后也选择到爱丁堡信息学院进一步学习，而不是继续留在中国学习金融。但是我一直是喜欢
- prefer smaill team. 团结， 高效，我有一些朋友在bank工作. 更多的挑战和机遇，发展空间
- Mr William Beauchamp video really inspire me. totally agree with his opinions. and I believe they are also the opinions of seamless. I will learn a lot.我们都是从经济学开始学起，非常相信机器学习将会在这个领域多么的有用，我有时候会后悔学金融而不是直接学计算机，但是可能那样我就不会如此热爱coding。
  - interest and hard-working make you successful
  - willing to take some risk, but not too much
  - 开创，视野，胆量，创新力和活力，打破常规，不安逸·，选择挑战
  - ml and coding， future. systemetic, backtesting, 相信客观的不是主观的。
  - everything is possible, everyone can do, small chance.
  - take a risk to look what is their limit.
  - challenge-driven

1. I see this opportunity as a way to contribute to a forward-thinking industry and tech-driven company. I firmly believe that ml is the future of quant. I used to study finance, traditional finance. Professors will teach us how to evaluate a company, how to analyze its financial situation, and how to judge whether its stock price will rise in the future. These are too subjective. , especially in China, 90% of the research reports are bullshit, useless and random. I don't like these, so I began to learn more and more programming and ml. Of course, the development of ml in quant still faces challenges. There are many challenges, I want to learn in such a forward-looking company and walk in the forefront of the industry with the company.
2. I have good programming skills and some experience, I can get to work faster, and I have a financial literacy background, which helps me solve problems. I believe that I will show a strong learning ability in my work and become proficient quickly. 
3. I watched the speech of Mr William Beauchamp, totally agree with his opinions. and I believe they are also the opinions of seamless. I like this team very much, we love challenges, we believe that everything is possible, everyone can do, take a risk to look what is their limit. Some of my friends work in banks and they often mention that they need very tedious processes, work The content lacks innovation, which is not to my liking.





## quant self-introduction

"Hi I'm John and I will graduat from UoE with a degree in Financial Computing. My interests are in quant analysis, data mining coding  and I love to create efficient and practical financial analysis with programming skill.

I previously do internships in one China hedge fund as a quant researcher. my job is to design QIS and build backtesting module.

I mainly deal with price data and volume data, which require a better skill of code efficency.  I create some self-build tool to accelarate some process using muti-processor and numpy.

I also try to do something different, combine some machine learning or deep learning method to research alternative data. For example, using  time series clustering to build attention factor from search index. Using CNN to construct picture recognition strategy and so on.

 some people do not believe machine learning . most of qis only appeared in papers,  real QIS do not trust ml.  can play a  role in financial world. and when i try to implement ml method, I also find some problem, such as the long training and updating time,  easily overfitting, not so clear economical logic. when we deal with alternative sdata, ml also have a high requirment for data quality and data size .我们都是从经济学开始学起，非常相信机器学习将会在这个领域多么的有用.

Back in school, I complete several programming courses and many coding-driven courses, including. I actively particapate in several research projects, they include sentiment ana, enviro, and green finance, I get experience in data visual, web crawl, scienctific computing and other things. even when I graduate , my undergraduate supervisor call me to contribute to his project and his textbook because of my coding skill.

I'm interested in the Q Developer role at Seamless because I always want to contribute my coding skill to such a tech-driven quant company,we believe the same future of quant and am inspired by the challenge and risk culture.



would you like to know anything else about me?



## What’s been the most challenging problem you have faced and how did you solve it?

In my most recent internship, the most chanllenging problem is my first strategy, It is about equity chip distribution.

 there are very complex computing for a large dataset, the basic code need one month to run it.

Though my mentor told me that’s OK and that is the fastest we can do, but I believe there are often a better solution in coding, which is what I am always want to learn, I love challenge myself, and I don't want to delay the progress of the whole team.

I return back to school, I ask some friends with good coding  and my professors for advice, I use my free time to modify the code, finally, I made it, I can get the result within 3 days. And I share the new method with my mentor and other colleague.

I love it, because it is challenging, challenge push me to improve myself fast, and I made it and share it, contribute to the whole team.



## give me an example when you work well with the team

Last semester, I received an invitation from my undergraduate tutor to participate in the compilation of the textbook "Big Data Finance", and was responsible for the writing team of Chapters 3 to 5. The main content is the basic introduction of statistical learning and machine learning methods and the development of application cases in the financial field. In a two-month period, my requirements for my team have always been rigorous planning and adequate communication. Weekly updated schedules and regular meetings are my way, especially for cases where we ask for original data and code, and strive to explore truly useful financial applications.

The problem encountered in this is that, especially in the ridge regression and lasso regression involved in Chapter 5, the responsible students do not have a thorough grasp of the knowledge, and there are many mistakes in the first draft. In actual work, we will also encounter the situation that there are shortcomings in the team. My solution is to take problem solving as the first priority, point out the deficiencies in time, and add more manpower and energy without delaying other progress. into the writing of this part.

During this process, I improved my communication skills, *managing multiple tasks and deadlines.*, and as a leader, I also need to have a basic understanding of the overall tasks, and be able to have the final check on the accuracy.

Of course, I also have shortcomings. I added a lot of my own ideas to the content of the chapters, but I did not communicate with the tutor in time, and I am not good at making opinions. This is something I should pay attention to in the future.





## your strength and weakness

strength, 

I consider **background in both data science and finance** to be one of my greatest strengths. Those who are good at finance, they may know the better than me, but they have poor coding skill, they cannot do the  tech job. Those who major in CS, they are professional in coding, but I will understand the trading problems better and faster than them.

I am creative and very interested in this domain. I always want to **make a thing better,** Make a plot more beautiful and vivid, make a strategy more robust, make a function more beautiful and fast, and make myself more skilled.,=

I love c**hallenge and risk, but I am rational.** Challenges are the biggest motivation for me to improve and learn, and even if I fail I get a lot of experience from it. And I know how to control myself, don't let my emotions control me, and don't let the risks exceed my controllable range.

I am friendly and easy to get along with. I like to **work with a team,** one person will always have shortcomings, 1+1>2, learning from each other is also the fastest way to learn. And I am good at cooking, if there is a chance, I can invite everyone to dinner.

weakness,

I struggle with **negative criticism**, and can become obsessed with perfecting my work after receiving notes from a supervisor. While I appreciate the guidance, I think I can learn to be less harsh on myself.

I don't have much experience in software engineering, although I have learned it in some projects, but I haven't taken a systematic course, but I am now seriously studying software engineering courses on coursera, I believe I will make up for this soon a little.
